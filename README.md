# 10-BIT-PDAC
The aim of the project is to design a 10 Bit Potentiometric Digital to Analog Converter using open-source EDA tools.

# Tools Used

Ngspice-ngspice is the open source spice simulator for electric and electronic circuits. Such a circuit may comprise of JFETs, bipolar and MOS transistors, passive elements like R, L, or C, diodes, transmission lines and other devices, all interconnected in a netlist.

Magic VLSI-Magic stands for Manhattan Artwork Generator for Integrated Circuits. It is a vlsi layout tool. As free and open-source software magic continuesto be a popular layout tool as it is easy to and expand for specilised tasks.

Esim - eSim (previously known as Oscad / FreeEDA) is a free/libre and open source EDA tool for circuit design, simulation, analysis and PCB design. It is an integrated tool built using free/libre and open source software such as KiCad, Ngspice and GHDL. eSim is released under GPL.
